Notes assembling,linking and running exit.s

After entering the code on pps. 19-20:

pftgu> as exit.s -o exit.o     # Assemble source
pftgu> ld exit.o -o exit       # Link source
pftgu> ./exit ; echo $?        # Run and verify return code
0

pftgu> vi exit.s               # Edit source
pftgu> ./exit ; echo $?        # Demonstrate only source has changed
0

nd-up> as exit.s -o exit.o
nd-up> ld exit.o -o exit
nd-up> ./exit ; echo $?        # Rerun to demonstrate change
4


Note: Changed the value of $0 to $4 in the line:

              movl $0 %ebx 

      to change the return value from 0 to 4
